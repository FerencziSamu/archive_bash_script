# Welcome!

So far if you wish to create the archive file on your local machine, please create a "backup" folder in your ROOT (/) directory and copy-paste the backup and restore files over there,
then run the backup.sh!

The restore works the same, once you think you need to reload the archived files, run the restore.sh script! Please make note it does not overwrite the files what are only 
located on your local machine and are NOT in the archived file!
